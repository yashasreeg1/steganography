Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography
Introduction
This project implements image-based steganography to securely hide confidential data within an image. Using Python and OpenCV, the system encodes and extracts hidden messages without altering the image's visible quality. This technique ensures secure communication and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Features
Data Security: Conceals secret messages within an image.
Undetectable Embedding: Hidden data does not distort the image visually.
Efficient Encoding & Decoding: Fast and reliable extraction of hidden information.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple execution using Python scripts.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
opencv-python (cv2) – Image processing
numpy – Data manipulation
PIL – Image handling
stegno.py – Custom steganography script
Installation & Setup
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/steganography.git
cd steganography
Install dependencies
pip install opencv-python 
Run the script
To encode a message into an image
python stegno.py encode input_image.png "Your secret message"
To decode a message from an image
python stegno.py decode encoded_image.png
Usage
This project is useful for:
Cybersecurity & Data Protection
Covert Communication
Digital Watermarking
End Users
Journalists & Activists – Protect sensitive reports.
Corporate Users – Secure transmission of classified information.
General Users – Personal privacy and confidential messaging.
Conclusion
This project provides an effective solution for secure data hiding using steganography techniques. By embedding hidden messages within images, it ensures confidentiality, integrity, and undetectable communication, making it a reliable approach for secure data transmission.
